# An Architectural Blueprint for High-Velocity, Accessibility-First Testing

## I. Strategic Framework: A Multi-Layered Approach to Accessible Testing

Achieving an **accessibility-first** testing strategy at high velocity requires a test architecture that is both **fast** and **thorough**. We must embed accessibility into everyday development without creating a slow feedback loop. The proposed framework adopts a multi-layered approach: a rapid inner loop for component tests and a comprehensive outer loop for end-to-end (E2E) validation.

This architecture reflects recent tooling decisions. Notably, we leverage the speed of the **Bun** runtime for most unit and integration tests, while compensating for its limitations with a parallel **Node.js** harness for accessibility scans. On top of this, we employ **Playwright** as an outer test loop to cover all aspects of the user experience. Each layer has a distinct role, ensuring that accessibility is verified at every stage without compromising developer productivity.

### 1.1 Deconstructing the Happy-DOM Deadlock: Bun vs. `axe-core`

Initial experiments exposed a fundamental deadlock between Bun's default DOM simulation and the industry-standard accessibility engine, **`axe-core`**. Bun’s test runner is engineered for extreme speed and recommends using **Happy DOM** for simulating the browser environment. **Happy DOM** is a lightweight, fast implementation of browser APIs – but its quest for speed comes at a cost. It diverges from web standards in subtle ways that clash with `axe-core`.

The most critical incompatibility lies in Happy DOM’s handling of the **`Node.isConnected`** property. This DOM API indicates if a node is attached to the document. `axe-core` relies on modifying `isConnected` during its DOM traversal. In Happy DOM, `isConnected` is implemented as a read-only property (and not fully standard), causing `axe-core` to throw runtime errors when it attempts to set it. In practice, this means any accessibility scan using `axe-core` fails outright under Happy DOM1. Community reports and library documentation confirm this issue: the maintainers of `vitest-axe` (a Vitest/Jest integration for axe) explicitly warn that their matcher is **incompatible** with Happy DOM environments.

Unfortunately, Bun’s test runner **does not yet support** the more standards-compliant **JSDOM** environment (the de facto choice for Node-based DOM testing). JSDOM would solve the `isConnected` issue, but Bun cannot use it as a drop-in replacement at this time2. This presents a catch-22:

- Bun’s recommended path for DOM tests is Happy DOM (for speed).

- `axe-core` cannot operate under Happy DOM due to fundamental API mismatch.

- The only viable alternative (JSDOM) isn’t supported in Bun’s native runner.

In summary, **Bun alone cannot run component-level accessibility scans** today. This impasse is not a matter of configuration or minor bug; it’s a fundamental limitation of the current Bun + Happy DOM pairing. We must therefore adjust our strategy to retain Bun’s performance benefits *and* enable `axe-core` scans through other means. The solution is a **hybrid testing approach**: run most tests in Bun for speed, but outsource accessibility-specific tests to a Node.js environment that supports JSDOM.

### 1.2 A Hybrid Solution: Node.js + JSDOM for A11y Scans

To resolve the deadlock, we introduce a **parallel Node.js test harness** dedicated to accessibility checks. Rather than abandoning Bun entirely (and its performance gains), we isolate the `axe-core` scans into their own test suite running on Node.js. In practice, this means writing our accessibility tests in separate files – for example, naming them `*.a11y.test.tsx` – and executing them with a Node-based runner that uses JSDOM. All other unit and integration tests continue to run with `bun test` using Happy DOM as usual.

Under this hybrid model, **Bun** remains the primary test engine for the vast majority of tests (ensuring fast feedback), and **Node+JSDOM** is invoked as needed for the specific cases that require `axe-core`. This dual setup gives us the “best of both worlds”:

- **Fast feedback for logic and UI structure:** Bun’s test runner with Happy DOM provides near-instant execution for tests that verify component behavior, state management, and basic rendering structure. Developers get immediate feedback in their inner loop without waiting on a heavy browser simulation.

- **Standards-compliant DOM for accessibility rules:** A Node environment can host JSDOM, a more complete DOM implementation that `axe-core` supports. By running `axe` in this context, we can catch semantic and structural accessibility issues that Bun/Happy DOM would miss or error on.

To keep the Node-based tests efficient, we leverage **tsgo** (TypeScript’s new fast compiler) to compile and launch these tests. A typical setup could use a lightweight command (for example, `npx tsgo`) to transpile the `*.a11y.test.tsx` files on the fly and execute them in Node. This avoids the overhead of a full Jest or Vitest context for the accessibility suite. Essentially, we treat these a11y tests as a specialized batch of scripts: they set up JSDOM, render components, run `axe-core`, and report results.

Crucially, the separation of test files by naming convention means we can run the two suites independently. A typical workflow might include two NPM scripts: one for the **fast tests** (`npm run test:unit` using Bun) and one for the **a11y tests** (`npm run test:a11y` using Node). In continuous integration, these can run in parallel or in sequence, but they are logically isolated. This prevents any slow-down of the primary suite; if accessibility scans are a bit slower due to JSDOM’s overhead, they won’t make the core test run (which developers execute frequently) any slower. It also provides flexibility – for example, a developer in rapid prototyping mode can run just the Bun tests, and only run the axe checks when needed or in a pre-commit hook.

By introducing a Node+JSDOM harness for `axe-core`, we unblock our accessibility-first strategy without sacrificing performance. Bun remains at the center of our testing, but we now have a reliable secondary path to perform **automated accessibility audits** at the component level.

### 1.3 Acknowledging Limits: What JSDOM **Can’t** Catch

Even with JSDOM enabling `axe-core` scans, it’s important to set realistic expectations. **No simulated DOM environment (Happy DOM or JSDOM) can replace a real browser for certain accessibility validations.** JSDOM is purely a DOM parser and engine; it does **not** perform visual rendering, apply CSS layout, or run the browser’s accessibility tree computations. This means some accessibility rules are beyond its scope.

The official Axe documentation notes "limited support for JSDOM" and advises disabling rules that are known to yield false results in a headless DOM3. The most prominent example is the **color contrast** rule. Verifying color contrast requires computing rendered text colors against background pixels – something impossible without an actual rendering engine (JSDOM has no concept of pixels or CSS cascade in effect). Any `axe-core` rule that depends on actual rendering or CSS will fail or produce irrelevant results under JSDOM. Besides `color-contrast`, other rules in this category include:

- **Target size** (minimum touch target dimensions)

- **Scrollable region focusable** (requires knowing if overflow renders scrollbars)

- **Visual focus indicators** (CSS outline or highlight on focusable elements)

- Etc.

We address this by **disabling such rules in the component-layer tests** and deferring their verification to the Playwright E2E layer. In practice, our Node-based axe test harness will load `axe-core` with a configuration that turns off rules like `color-contrast` and any others that rely on styles or layout. For example, we globally disable `color-contrast` in these tests and explicitly document that **contrast must be checked in the browser**. Similarly, a rule like `scrollable-region-focusable` (which might flag an element for not being keyboard-focusable if it’s scrollable) is unreliable without actual CSS overflow calculations; we’ll ignore it in JSDOM scans and instead have a keyboard navigation test cover it in the E2E suite.

Understanding these limits reinforces our need for the **outer test loop**. The inner loop (Bun + Node/axe tests) catches semantic issues (like missing ARIA labels, improper roles, missing alt text, etc.), but it **cannot fully guarantee** things like proper color contrast, focus order on actual UI, or dynamic content announcements. We explicitly rely on **real browser testing with Playwright** to cover those. This separation of concerns ensures we don’t develop a false sense of security from our fast tests – we know exactly which checks happen later in the pipeline.

With the strategic foundation laid, we can now delve into each layer of the architecture: the fast feedback inner loop powered by Bun (augmented with Node-based axe scans), and the comprehensive outer loop powered by Playwright.

## II. The Inner Loop: Fast, Accessible Component Testing with Bun & JSDOM

The “inner loop” is where developers spend most of their time. It encompasses the rapid unit and component tests run during active development – often on every file save or commit. Our goal for this layer is to **make accessibility a built-in aspect of these fast tests**. Every time a developer tests a component’s logic or rendering, we want accessibility checks to happen automatically and with minimal overhead.

To achieve this, we structure the inner loop into two synergistic parts:

- **2.1 Bun Test Runner + Happy DOM for Core Tests** – ultra-fast execution of component tests for logic, state, and basic rendering using Bun’s native test framework.

- **2.2 Node + JSDOM Axe Tests for Accessibility** – focused tests that specifically scan components with `axe-core` to catch semantic issues, running in a Node environment in parallel to the Bun tests.

- **2.3 Accessible-First Test Practices** – a set of conventions for writing tests (in both parts above) that ensure we’re using accessible selectors and asserting on meaningful output, effectively doubling as accessibility verification.

Together, these ensure that by the time a component leaves the inner loop, it isn’t just functionally correct – it’s also **accessible by design**.

### 2.1 Ultra-Fast Execution with Bun and Happy DOM

Bun’s built-in test runner serves as our default for all standard tests. We configure `bun test` with Happy DOM as the global DOM (`--preload ./tests/setup-happy-dom.ts` in our NPM script) so that each test file can create `document` and `window` as if running in a browser. The payoff is speed: Bun’s runtime and Happy DOM allow most tests to run in **milliseconds**, keeping the feedback loop extremely tight.

In these Bun-driven tests, we cover things like:

- **Component Rendering and Props:** Does the component render the right output given certain props or state?

- **State Transitions:** When we simulate a user action or change a context value, does the component update correctly?

- **Basic Accessibility attributes:** If a component is supposed to have certain ARIA attributes or roles, are they present in the rendered output?

For example, suppose we have a `<ThemeProvider>` context and a `<MobileShell>` layout component. A Bun test might verify that when the theme context is applied, the DOM gets a `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element:

```
tsxCopy code`import { describe, it, expect } from 'bun:test';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { act } from 'react';

// ... import our ThemeProvider and a test component

describe('ThemeProvider integration', () => {
  it('applies the default theme to <html> and <body>', () => {
    const container = document.createElement('div');
    document.body.appendChild(container);
    const root = createRoot(container);

    act(() => {
      root.render(<ThemeProvider><span id="probe" /></ThemeProvider>);
    });

    const probe = container.querySelector('#probe');
    expect(probe).toBeTruthy();
    // Check that the theme data attribute was applied globally
    expect(document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme')).toBe('wildside-night');
    expect(document.body.getAttribute('data-theme')).toBe('wildside-night');
    
    root.unmount();
  });
});
`
```

In this snippet, the Bun test quickly sets up a React root in a fake DOM, renders a component, and makes assertions. The usage of `document.querySelector` and standard DOM APIs is possible thanks to Happy DOM. Tests like this run blazingly fast (no real browser, no JSDOM overhead) and can be run hundreds of times a minute during development.

**Happy DOM Caveat:** As discussed, Happy DOM isn’t fully standards-compliant. We **limit our usage of Happy DOM to tests that do not require full fidelity**. That typically means we avoid deep CSS or canvas-related testing here. For most React component output and event simulation, Happy DOM is sufficient and incredibly fast. Whenever we bump into a limitation (like an API not implemented or a discrepancy), we document it. In many cases, simple polyfills or slight test adjustments can work around minor differences.

### 2.2 Automated Accessibility Scans via Node + JSDOM

To complement Bun’s lightning-fast tests, we run a parallel suite of **accessibility-focused tests** in Node. These tests are responsible for running `axe-core` against our components. They ensure that from a semantic standpoint, components meet WCAG guidelines (no missing labels, correct roles, valid ARIA attributes, etc.) before we even integrate them into pages.

**Test Structure and Naming:** We suffix these files with `.a11y.test.tsx` (for example, `Button.a11y.test.tsx`, `Modal.a11y.test.tsx`) to clearly distinguish them. This naming serves two purposes: it signals their purpose, and it allows us to target them specifically in our test scripts. We might configure our package scripts such that `npm run test:a11y` only picks up files matching `*.a11y.test.tsx`. In CI, this makes it trivial to run the accessibility suite separately from (and possibly in parallel with) the main Bun test suite.

**JSDOM Setup:** Each a11y test file uses **JSDOM** as its DOM environment. We can either initialize JSDOM manually within the test, or use a Node test runner that supports JSDOM globally. One lightweight approach is writing a small harness script that, for each `.a11y.test.tsx` file:

- Spins up a JSDOM instance (e.g. using `new JSDOM('<!DOCTYPE html><html><body></body></html>')` and setting global `window` and `document`).

- Mounts the React component into that JSDOM document (likely using ReactDOM or Testing Library’s `render`).

- Runs `axe-core` on the JSDOM’s DOM tree.

- Asserts that there are no violations.

We can automate this using familiar libraries. For instance, **React Testing Library** can be used to render components into the JSDOM document easily, and the **axe-core API** (via something like `jest-axe` or `vitest-axe` utilities) can perform the scan. The following illustrates a typical pattern, written in a Jest/Vitest style (which is similar to what our custom harness would do):

```
tsxCopy code`// Button.a11y.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
import Button from './Button';

// Extend expect for the axe matcher (if using jest-axe)
expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

test('Button has no accessibility violations and is properly labelled', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<Button>Click Me</Button>);
  
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();  // Custom matcher asserts zero axe issues

  // Also verify accessible name and role are correct as a sanity check:
  const btn = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i });
  expect(btn).toBeInTheDocument();
});
`
```

In this example, when run in a Node+JSDOM environment, the `Button` component is rendered off-screen and scanned. The test will fail if, for instance, the `<Button>` component is missing an accessible name or has ARIA attributes misused. By including a Testing Library query (`getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i })`), we double-verify that the component is not only *free of axe-detectable violations* but also that it adheres to expected accessibility APIs (here, that a button with text "Click Me" indeed yields an element with role `button` and that label).

We apply this pattern to all interactive components. A more complex example is a **Modal** component which might be hidden or shown based on props:

```
tsxCopy code`// Modal.a11y.test.tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe } from 'jest-axe';
import Modal from './Modal';

describe('Modal component accessibility', () => {
  test('has no violations when closed', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<Modal open={false} title="Sample Modal" />);
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
    // Even though modal is closed (perhaps rendered off-screen or not at all), 
    // we ensure no stray violations like missing landmarks.
  });

  test('has no violations when open', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<Modal open={true} title="Sample Modal"><p>Content</p></Modal>);
    // Temporarily disable a page-level rule that is irrelevant in isolation:
    const results = await axe(container, {
      rules: {
        region: { enabled: false }  // disable landmark rule since modal isn't wrapped in <main> here
      }
    });
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });
});
`
```

In the second test, we demonstrate **contextual rule configuration**: the `region` rule (which requires content be within landmarks like `<main>`) is not applicable when testing a Modal in isolation, so we disable it. This ability to tweak axe’s rules per test helps avoid false positives and keeps our test signal clean. Every axe violation we see in this suite should correspond to a genuine issue that a user might encounter.

**Execution and Performance:** Running these Node/JSDOM tests is slower than the Bun tests – JSDOM startup and axe analysis take time – but they are still relatively fast. A simple component scan might take on the order of tens of milliseconds to a couple hundred milliseconds. We mitigate performance concerns by a) running these tests in parallel (Node can leverage multiple processes or threads if we use a test runner), and b) keeping each test focused on a single component or state to avoid heavy DOMs. In CI, we could further parallelize by splitting the accessibility tests across multiple machines if needed (though likely not necessary unless the suite grows very large).

The key outcome of this inner-loop accessibility suite is **immediate feedback on semantic issues**. If a developer forgets an `aria-label` on a button, a test fails right when they run `npm test`. This is far better than catching it days later in a manual audit or in a slow E2E test. It turns accessibility into a daily concern rather than a QA afterthought.

### 2.3 Accessible-First Test Practices: Enforcing Good Habits

Having the right tools is only half the battle. We also enforce **strict conventions in how tests are written**, to ensure our test code itself encourages accessible implementation. Two key practices are:

- **Use of Accessible Queries:** Tests must interact with the rendered DOM the same way a user or assistive technology would – i.e. by using accessible labels, roles, and text content. We forbid selecting elements by obscure hooks or internal IDs whenever a semantic alternative exists. In practice, this means favoring Testing Library queries like `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, or `getByText` over queries like `querySelector('[data-testid="..."]')`. If our tests cannot find an element by a meaningful label or role, that’s a red flag that the component might not be accessible.

*Policy:* The use of `data-testid` (or similar testing-only attributes) is considered a last resort. In code review, any test that uses a test ID must justify why a role or label could not be used instead. Often, the remedy is to improve the component (e.g. add an `aria-label` or proper text) such that a more user-centric query becomes possible. This policy creates a virtuous cycle: it pushes developers to build components with accessibility in mind (so they are easily testable), and it makes the tests more robust by tying them to user-visible strings and roles.

*Example:* In the `GlobalControls` component test, instead of selecting a toggle button by an ID or class, we query it by its accessible name:

```
tsxCopy code`const displayToggle = mountNode.querySelector("button[aria-label='Switch to Full View']");
expect(displayToggle).toBeTruthy();
`
```

Here we rely on the presence of `aria-label="Switch to Full View"` on the button. If that label were missing or changed, the test would fail – which is good, because the accessible contract of the UI changed. In a future refactor, we might rewrite such a query using Testing Library’s `getByRole('button', { name: 'Switch to Full View' })` for clarity. Either way, the test asserts something a screen reader user would care about: that there is a button with that label.

- **Assertions on Accessibility Outcomes:** In addition to low-level assertions (like “this state toggled” or “this element exists”), we add assertions specifically for accessibility expectations. For instance, after clicking a button that opens a modal, we might assert that focus moved to the modal dialog element (using `expect(dialog).toHaveFocus()` or checking `document.activeElement`). Or after toggling a theme, we assert that the `<html lang>` or `data-theme` attributes are correctly set. By writing these into tests, we ensure that accessibility features (focus management, ARIA attributes, language attributes, etc.) aren’t accidentally broken. It’s far easier to debug an automated test failure pointing to a missing `lang` attribute than to wait for a manual audit.

To enforce these practices, we integrate ESLint rules and testing guidelines:

- We enable **ESLint plugins like Testing Library’s `prefer-user-event` and `prefer-accessible-queries`** which warn if a test uses `getByTestId` when a role query is available, or if it calls low-level DOM methods instead of simulating real user events.

- In pull request reviews, the team is instructed to flag any test code that doesn’t adhere to accessible-first querying. Over time this becomes second nature.

By combining tooling (axe scans, proper libraries) with conventions (only use accessible queries, assert on ARIA/focus behaviors), our inner loop becomes a strong quality gate. A developer cannot merge a component that is functionally perfect but accessibly flawed – the tests would catch it.

## III. The Outer Loop: Comprehensive E2E Validation with Playwright

While the inner loop verifies individual components in isolation, the **outer loop** ensures that the application works as a cohesive, accessible whole. Here we use **Playwright** to run end-to-end tests in real browsers. The outer loop addresses everything that a simulated environment cannot: actual rendering, styling, user interactions across components, and integration of features like routing and dynamic content. It is our final safety net and a place to conduct more intensive audits, including visual and internationalization checks.

Playwright was chosen for its robust multi-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), its powerful automation APIs, and built-in test runner that integrates assertions, parallelization, and rich reporting. This section outlines how we leverage Playwright for various accessibility-focused E2E tasks:

- **3.1 In-Browser Axe Scans:** Running `axe-core` in a **real browser** context to catch issues like color contrast, focus order, and other things JSDOM can’t detect.

- **3.2 Advanced Interaction Tests:** Simulating keyboard navigation, verifying focus management (e.g., modals trapping focus, return focus on close), and other workflow-oriented checks.

- **3.3 Accessibility Tree Snapshots:** Capturing and diffing the browser’s accessibility tree to detect unintended semantic changes over time.

- **3.4 Visual Regression across Viewports/Themes:** Taking screenshots of pages/components in various layouts to catch visual bugs that could affect usability or clarity.

- **3.5 Localization and Language Verification:** Testing the app under different locale settings to ensure language-specific attributes and content appear correctly.

This battery of tests runs less frequently (e.g., on pull request or nightly builds) due to being heavier, but it is exhaustive in ensuring real-world accessibility compliance.

### 3.1 Strategic Axe Scans in the Browser

We integrate `axe-core` into Playwright tests via the `@axe-core/playwright` utility. This allows us to inject the axe script into pages and analyze the rendered output for violations. The **advantage** here is that in a real browser, axe can evaluate everything – including CSS, canvas, and the actual computed tree. For example, the color contrast rule will now produce meaningful results because it can compute actual colors on the page.

However, we must be strategic to avoid slowing down the suite. Running a full axe scan after every action would turn our E2E tests into a slog. Instead, we treat accessibility scans as **targeted assertions** at critical checkpoints of a user flow:

- **After initial page load:** We often scan the fully loaded page to ensure no glaring issues on the baseline UI.

- **After major UI transitions:** For example, after opening a modal, after navigating to a new page, after triggering a form validation that reveals errors, etc. These are points where new content appears or state significantly changes, warranting a re-check.

- **Scope the scan to changed regions:** Using `AxeBuilder.include(selector)` we can limit analysis to specific parts of the DOM. For instance, after opening a modal, we can scan *only* the modal dialog element instead of the entire page (which saves time and focuses results).

**Example – Modal Workflow:** Consider a test of an e-commerce flow where clicking "Add to Cart" opens a dialog. We can write:

```
tsCopy code`import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { AxeBuilder } from '@axe-core/playwright';

test.describe('Add to Cart Modal Flow', () => {
  test('main page has no axe violations on load', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/products');
    const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
    expect(results.violations).toEqual([]);
  });

  test('modal dialog is accessible after opening', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/products');
    // Trigger the modal
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' }).click();
    // Ensure modal is visible
    const modal = page.locator('#add-to-cart-modal');
    await expect(modal).toBeVisible();
    // Run axe only inside the modal
    const modalResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).include('#add-to-cart-modal').analyze();
    expect(modalResults.violations).toEqual([]);
  });
});
`
```

In this snippet, the first test scans the full page and expects zero violations (meaning our base page structure is solid). The second test specifically clicks the "Add to Cart" button (again, using an **accessible query** by role and name, ensuring the button is labeled properly) and then waits for the modal. We then scan just the modal content for violations. If, say, the modal was missing an `aria-label` on its header or had a form control without a label, `axe-core` would catch it here.

By **scoping axe scans and using them sparingly**, we avoid a performance hit. Each scan might take a second or two on a large page, so we do it only where it yields new information. The principle is: **treat accessibility scans as assertions, not as a blanket afterthought**. This way, our E2E tests remain fast enough to run in CI while still covering critical scenarios.

### 3.2 Interactive Behavior and Focus Management

Automated accessibility testing must extend beyond static analysis. Many accessibility issues are only apparent when users actually interact with the UI. With Playwright’s control of the browser, we can simulate these interactions and validate the application’s response. Two major areas we concentrate on are **keyboard navigation** and **focus handling**.

#### 3.2.1 Keyboard Navigation Flow Tests

A core WCAG principle is that **all functionality should be operable via keyboard** (no mouse required). We write E2E tests that mimic a user pressing `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, `Enter`, and `Escape` keys to navigate and activate components.

For example, consider verifying the navigation menu and search input in a header:

```
tsCopy code`test('Home page header is fully keyboard-navigable', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  // Press Tab repeatedly and check focus moves in the expected order
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  let focused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.textContent);
  expect(focused).toMatch(/Products/i);  // focus on "Products" link
  
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  focused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.getAttribute('aria-label'));
  expect(focused).toBe('Search');  // now search box is focused (identified by its aria-label)
  
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  focused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.textContent);
  expect(focused).toMatch(/My Account/i);  // now "My Account" button is focused

  // Reverse navigation
  await page.keyboard.down('Shift');
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  await page.keyboard.up('Shift');
  focused = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.getAttribute('aria-label'));
  expect(focused).toBe('Search');
});
`
```

This script tabs through the interactive elements of the header and uses the `document.activeElement` to check which element is currently focused. We verify that focus cycles through **Products link → Search input → My Account button** in order, and that it can go backwards as well. If an element was not reachable via Tab (e.g., missing a `tabindex` or not a natural focusable element), this test would catch it.

We do similar tests for menus, dialogs, and other composite components:

- Ensuring that pressing **Enter** on a focused button triggers the expected action (Playwright’s `page.keyboard.press('Enter')` can be used).

- Ensuring **Escape** closes dialogs or dropdowns when focused inside them.

- Verifying there are no **keyboard traps**: focus should never get stuck in a loop or lost off-screen. For modals, we *want* focus trap within the modal while it’s open (so Tab doesn’t go behind the modal), but when the modal closes, focus should return to a sensible place (often the button that opened it).

These tests give us confidence that a sighted keyboard user or a visually impaired user using keyboard + screen reader can navigate and operate the app fully.

#### 3.2.2 Focus Handling in Dialogs and Overlays

Building on keyboard tests, we specifically check **modal dialogs, popovers, and other overlays** for proper focus management:

- When a modal opens, the first interactive element inside it should receive focus (or the modal container itself, if it has `tabindex="-1"` to catch focus).

- Tab should wrap within the modal (since modals typically trap focus until closed).

- When the modal closes, focus should restore to the element that opened it (or another logical location).

Playwright makes it straightforward to test these conditions:

```
tsCopy code`// Assume the "Add to Cart" modal from earlier tests
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' }).click();
const modalDialog = page.locator('#add-to-cart-modal');
await expect(modalDialog).toBeVisible();

// The first focusable element in modal should be focused.
const firstFocusable = modalDialog.locator('button').first();
await expect(firstFocusable).toBeFocused();

// Press Tab repeatedly within modal and ensure focus stays in modal
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
  const activeId = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement?.closest('#add-to-cart-modal')?.id);
  expect(activeId).toBe('add-to-cart-modal');
}

// Close modal (press Escape or click close button)
await page.keyboard.press('Escape');
await expect(modalDialog).toBeHidden();

// After closing, focus should return to the "Add to Cart" button
const triggerButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to Cart' });
await expect(triggerButton).toBeFocused();
`
```

This sequence rigorously checks focus containment and restoration. If any step fails (focus leaves the modal, or doesn’t return after closing), we know we have a bug in our focus management logic (perhaps a missing call to `.focus()` or incorrect `tabindex` attributes).

Such tests ensure **operability** – one of the four principles of accessibility (POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust). They catch issues that static analysis never could (for example, `axe-core` might not tell you that focus got lost when a dialog closed).

### 3.3 Accessibility Tree Snapshots for Semantic Regression

In a complex UI, it’s possible to inadvertently change or break semantic structure while refactoring, even if everything “looks” fine visually. To guard against this, we use **accessibility tree snapshots** in Playwright. The accessibility tree is what assistive technologies actually interact with – essentially a computed structure derived from the DOM, listing elements with roles, names, and properties as a screen reader would perceive them.

Playwright provides an API `page.accessibility.snapshot()` that returns this tree. We have adopted a pattern of taking **snapshot files** (in a serialized format like JSON or YAML) of key components or pages, and then using a custom matcher to compare future runs against the baseline. This is analogous to visual snapshot testing, but for semantics.

We created a custom Expect matcher (e.g., `toMatchAriaSnapshot()`) which simplifies this. The first time a test runs, it will generate a snapshot file (for example, `product-card.spec.ts-snapshots/product-card-accessibility.yml`). Subsequent runs will diff the current accessibility tree against that file and fail the test if there’s any difference (except for whitelisted changes).

**Example – Product Card Component:**

```
tsCopy code`test('ProductCard maintains accessible structure', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/products/widget-pro');
  const card = page.locator('.product-card');
  // Expect the accessibility tree of the product card to match the stored baseline
  await expect(card).toMatchAriaSnapshot();
});
`
```

On first run, `toMatchAriaSnapshot()` will save something like:

```
yamlCopy code`role: 'group'
name: 'Widget Pro'
children:
  - role: 'image'
    name: 'Widget Pro product image'
  - role: 'heading'
    name: 'Widget Pro'
    level: 2
  - role: 'paragraph'
    name: '$19.99'
  - role: 'button'
    name: 'Add to Cart'
`
```

(This is a conceptual illustration of what the accessibility snapshot might contain.)

If a developer accidentally changed the `h2` in `ProductCard` to an `h3` or removed an aria-label on the image, the next test run would produce a different snapshot and cause a failure. This kind of regression test is **highly sensitive to meaningful changes** but **robust to cosmetic ones**. Unlike raw HTML snapshots (which would break on any minor markup change), the accessibility snapshot ignores irrelevant container `<div>`s or styling hooks and focuses purely on roles, names, and structure. If an extra `<div>` is added for layout but doesn’t affect roles or names, the snapshot remains the same. But if, say, a heading level changes or a label is lost, the difference is caught immediately.

This technique gives us confidence that as we refactor or iterate on components, we’re not silently altering the user’s accessible experience. It’s especially useful for ensuring things like:

- Headings hierarchy remains correct (no suddenly skipping from h2 to h4, etc.).

- Buttons and links retain their names.

- Images keep their alt text or accessible name.

- Regions and landmarks (like nav, main, footer) remain in place.

We incorporate accessibility snapshot tests for all major composite components and pages. They serve as a guardrail for semantic consistency.

### 3.4 Visual Regression Testing across Breakpoints and Themes

Accessibility isn’t just about screen readers and keyboard nav – visual presentation matters too. Issues like text getting cut off, color contrast in different themes, or layout breakage on small screens can dramatically affect usability. To catch these, we include **visual regression tests** in our Playwright suite.

Using Playwright’s screenshot capabilities, we generate snapshots of pages or components under various conditions and compare them to baselines. Key dimensions we cover:

- **Different screen sizes (responsive breakpoints):** We test layouts on a small mobile viewport (e.g. 375×667) vs a desktop viewport (e.g. 1280×800). This ensures our responsive design doesn’t introduce inaccessible overflow or hiding of content on small screens.

- **Light and Dark themes:** Since our application supports theme switching (e.g., `wildside-day` vs `wildside-night` themes), we capture each in screenshots. This helps verify color contrast in each theme and catches any color-specific asset issues (like an icon that’s not visible on a dark background).

- **Critical pages/components:** We focus on pages like the home dashboard, forms, and any component with complex styling (e.g., data visualization or maps in our context) for visual snapshots.

**Example – Responsive Header Snapshot:**

```
tsCopy code`test.describe('Header visual regression', () => {
  // Test at two breakpoints
  const viewports = { mobile: { width: 360, height: 740 }, desktop: { width: 1280, height: 800 } };
  for (const [label, size] of Object.entries(viewports)) {
    test(`header looks correct in ${label} view`, async ({ page }) => {
      await page.setViewportSize(size);
      await page.goto('/');  // go to homepage which includes the header
      // If theme defaults to dark, ensure it’s set for consistency
      await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(`header-${label}.png`);
    });
  }
});
`
```

The first run will save `header-mobile.png` and `header-desktop.png`. Subsequent runs will compare screenshots pixel-by-pixel. If a CSS change accidentally pushed the header’s menu off-screen on mobile, the diff will flag it. We have to manage the usual challenges of visual testing (ensuring consistent fonts, ignoring dynamic content), but Playwright has mechanisms for that (like disabling animations, using a standard font/locale).

For theme variations, we might have a test that explicitly toggles the theme:

```
tsCopy code`test('Settings panel visual regression in dark and light mode', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/settings');
  // Dark theme (default)
  await expect(page.locator('#settings-panel')).toHaveScreenshot('settings-dark.png');
  // Toggle theme button
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Switch to light theme' }).click();
  await expect(page.locator('#settings-panel')).toHaveScreenshot('settings-light.png');
});
`
```

Now we have baseline images for both dark and light modes of the settings panel. If in light mode some text becomes illegible (e.g., if we accidentally had white text on a light background), the screenshot difference will alert us. This is effectively an automated **contrast check** across themes, complementing what axe does. Axe will catch low contrast if configured, but visual snapshots give a human-verifiable artifact to review if something changes.

Visual regression tests are run sparingly because they can be resource-intensive and occasionally flaky (due to antialiasing differences, etc.). We mitigate flakiness by:

- Freezing dynamic data (e.g., use test accounts or stubbed dates so that today’s date or random data doesn’t spoil the snapshot).

- Using tolerances or masking for known nondeterministic regions if needed.

- Running on consistent infrastructure (same browser versions, etc., via Playwright’s Docker or the cloud workers).

The payoff is worthwhile: we get an assurance that the UI looks as intended and remains usable at a glance. Many accessibility issues manifest visually (like an off-screen element or overlapping text), so these tests catch problems that neither axe nor unit tests would.

### 3.5 Localization and Internationalization Checks

Finally, accessibility extends to supporting users from different locales and languages. An often overlooked aspect is ensuring that our app properly handles localization – both in terms of content and technical attributes like the page’s language. We add E2E tests to validate internationalization (i18n) features:

- **Locale-specific content loading:** If our app is translated or supports multiple languages, we verify that switching to a locale yields the correct text. For example, toggling the language setting to French should cause the UI text to change to French.

- **Language attributes:** We ensure the `<html lang="">` attribute is set correctly whenever the locale changes, and that any region-specific sub-tags (like `en-GB` vs `en-US`) are handled if needed. The `lang` attribute is critical for screen readers to switch voice profiles.

- **Directionality:** If we ever support right-to-left (RTL) languages, tests would verify that the `dir="rtl"` attribute is applied and that layout flips appropriately. (For now, assume LTR only, but the tests are structured to accommodate this if needed.)

Playwright allows us to simulate different locales by launching contexts with a specific locale. For example, `browser.newContext({ locale: 'fr-FR' })` would make `navigator.language` report French. Alternatively, if our app has a UI control for language, we use that.

**Example – Language Toggle:**

```
tsCopy code`test('app supports English and Spanish locales', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  // Default is English
  expect(await page.locator('html').getAttribute('lang')).toBe('en');
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Welcome' })).toBeVisible();
  
  // Switch locale via UI control (assuming a button or menu)
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Español' }).click();
  // Now the page should be in Spanish
  expect(await page.locator('html').getAttribute('lang')).toBe('es');
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Bienvenido' })).toBeVisible();
});
`
```

In this test, we verify two things: the `<html lang>` attribute changes from "en" to "es", and the content of a heading changed from "Welcome" to "Bienvenido". If either fails, it indicates a localization issue (either content didn’t load, or we forgot to update the lang attribute in the code).

For more thorough coverage, we can run an entire suite in a non-default locale using Playwright’s test config. For instance, duplicate some critical E2E tests under a fixture where the context is launched with `{ locale: 'es-ES' }`. That way, we are not only testing the toggle, but also that the Spanish version of various flows has no axe violations and passes the same checks as English. This ensures no translation accidentally introduces an accessibility issue (e.g., a Spanish string that’s extremely long might cause a layout overflow which our visual tests would catch).

By treating localization as a first-class aspect of testing, we safeguard the **understandability** aspect of accessibility for all our supported audiences. It also has practical benefits: we catch missing translation keys or formatting issues early.

## IV. Performance Strategy and CI Integration

Having a comprehensive test suite is great, but it must run efficiently to be viable in a fast-paced development setting. Our strategy layers the tests in such a way that we **fail fast** on the cheapest tests and defer the heavier tests to later, possibly parallelized, stages. We also integrate these layers into our Continuous Integration pipeline so that accessibility is continuously enforced.

### 4.1 Layered Test Execution for Speed

The test architecture naturally splits into tiers which we can execute separately:

- **Layer 1: Bun Unit/Integration Tests** – Extremely fast, should be run on every commit and even every file change in watch mode. These catch basic regressions immediately. If any of these fail, there’s no need to proceed further until fixed.

- **Layer 2: Node/JSDOM Axe Tests** – These are a bit slower but still relatively quick. They can run in parallel to Layer 1. In a local dev flow, a developer might not run these on every save, but certainly before pushing code. In CI, we run them on each PR. If an accessibility rule fails here, we fail the build (for serious issues) or at least flag it for fixing.

- **Layer 3: Playwright E2E Tests** – This is the slowest layer, involving real browsers and possibly multiple iterations (various viewports, etc.). We execute this layer less frequently, typically on pull request validation and nightly full runs. Within this layer, we can configure Playwright to shard tests across multiple workers (it automatically runs tests in parallel across CPU cores, and can run across browser types concurrently if configured). So even though each test is heavy, the suite can still complete in a reasonable time.

In CI, we take advantage of parallel jobs:

- We run the **Bun tests** in one job. Given Bun’s speed, this job might finish in, say, 30 seconds.

- Simultaneously, run the **axe a11y tests** in another job. This might also take on the order of seconds to a minute, depending on how many components we scan.

- In parallel, run the **Playwright E2E tests** in another job. This could take a few minutes, especially if running on 3 browsers or doing visual comparisons, but often Playwright can keep it around 2-5 minutes by parallelizing internally.

By splitting these, the overall CI time is roughly the max of these, not the sum. The **longest** will be the Playwright job. If that is, say, 4 minutes, and the others finish in 1 minute, our total CI test time is ~4 minutes. This is acceptable for a PR gate in exchange for the thorough coverage we get.

We configure our GitHub Actions (or equivalent CI) to reflect this structure:

- Job “Test: Bun” – runs `bun test` on all non-a11y tests.

- Job “Test: Accessibility (Node)” – runs our Node script for axe tests.

- Job “Test: E2E” – runs `npx playwright test` (possibly with some flags for trace or report).

- An overall workflow that depends on all three finishing. We can set fail-fast for certain jobs if desired (for instance, if Bun tests fail, maybe abort others to save resources).

This way, a quick failure (like a unit test failing or a basic axe rule failing) doesn’t require waiting for the whole E2E suite to complete – developers get immediate feedback on what broke.

Additionally, if test runtime ever becomes a concern (say our component count triples and Node axe tests slow down), we can further partition those tests. For example, run axe tests in parallel shards (maybe split by test file name across two processes). But at our current scope, this likely isn’t necessary.

### 4.2 CI Reporting and Failure Triage

Integrating into CI also means handling results smartly. We treat any **accessibility violation of high severity as a build failure**. For instance:

- If axe reports a **critical or serious** violation in either the component tests or E2E scans, the CI job fails. This prevents merging code that would introduce major accessibility regressions.

- We may allow **minor** or **moderate** issues to pass but log them, depending on our strictness level, with an automated task created to fix them. In practice, since our inner loop is catching most issues early, we expect few if any moderate issues by the time E2E runs. But for example, color contrast might be flagged as serious (which we’d treat as immediate failure requiring a fix), whereas something like a missing document `<title>` might be moderate (we would still fix it but it might not block the PR).

We use Playwright and our Node tests’ reporting capabilities to output machine-readable results (like JSON). A post-processing step in CI could parse the axe results and summarize any violations. We also generate **HTML reports** for easier debugging:

- The Node axe tests can produce an HTML report of all violations, with links to relevant DOM nodes and suggestions (using the output from `axe-core`).

- Playwright, by default, can produce an HTML report that includes screenshots, failing test traces, etc. We enable this and have the CI upload it as an artifact on failure.

Our team’s workflow is then: if a test fails, especially an accessibility one, the engineer can download the report artifact and see exactly what failed – for example, a Playwright trace showing that after clicking a button, the focus did not move as expected, or an axe report highlighting a missing form label.

Finally, we maintain a **culture of accessibility ownership**. Failing tests are not just turned green by updating the tests – the expectation is to *fix the underlying issue*. Because the tests are designed to catch real problems, the correct response to a failure is usually to correct the component or page (e.g., add the missing `aria-label`, adjust the color contrast in CSS, fix the focus logic in JavaScript).

To help manage this, we integrate severity tagging:

- Tests or checks can be annotated with severity levels (for example, using axe’s impact ratings). Our CI parser can distinguish and perhaps post a comment on the PR: “⚠️ Accessibility issue detected: **low contrast on button text** (critical). This must be resolved before merge.”

- For less critical issues that slip through, we create backlog tickets automatically. But ideally, our gating ensures everything important is caught and fixed in the same development cycle.

## V. Synthesis and Implementation Roadmap

The proposed testing framework delivers a **holistic, layered approach** to accessibility testing without sacrificing development speed. We combine fast component-level checks with full browser validation to ensure that every new UI piece is both **rapidly verified** and **truly accessible** in practice. Below is a summary of the two major layers and their roles:

**Dimension****Component Layer (Bun + Node/JSDOM)****E2E Layer (Playwright)****Primary Tools**Bun test runner (Happy DOM) for units; Node + JSDOM for axe scansPlaywright test runner (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with Axe**Environment**Simulated DOM (Happy DOM for speed; JSDOM for standards)Real browser environment (headless or headed as needed)**Scope of Tests**Isolated components and small integration pieces in memoryFull pages and user flows in the deployed app context**Execution Speed**Very fast (milliseconds per test file under Bun; a bit more for axe)Slower (seconds per test, overall minutes per suite)**Defects Caught****Structural/Semantic issues:** missing labels, incorrect roles, improper ARIA, form associations. Basic functional bugs in components. 
*(Visual/style issues generally not caught here due to Happy DOM/JSDOM limits.)***Visual & Interactive issues:** color contrast failures, element focus order, keyboard traps, missing focus outlines, responsive layout breakages, incorrect `lang` attributes, any integration logic issues. Plus validation of flows (modals, nav, etc.).**When to Run**On every code change or commit (developer inner loop); each PR as quick check.On each PR merge request (CI gating) and nightly full runs. Can be run locally for full regression before major releases.**CI Role**Fast feedback – fails the build quickly if a core test or axe rule fails, preventing bad code early.Final quality gate – ensures the merged product is accessible in reality. Also provides artifacts (screenshots, trace) for review.
This model ensures **accessibility is woven into every stage**: a developer gets immediate feedback in their IDE or terminal for obvious issues, and the CI catches anything that requires a real browser to detect.

### 5.1 Implementation Plan

To adopt this framework, a phased rollout is advisable:

**Phase 1: Setup Bun and Basic Testing (Day 0-1)**

- **Install/Verify Bun** in the project. Ensure the `bun:test` script is working with Happy DOM. Add a `tests/setup-happy-dom.ts` to configure any globals or polyfills (for example, setting `document.doctype` if needed, or configuring `window.fetch` if used in tests).

- **Establish Test Structure:** Decide on a directory convention (e.g., all tests in `tests/` folder, mirroring src structure). Ensure naming for a11y tests is in place (e.g., `*.a11y.test.tsx`).

- **Sample Bun Tests:** Write a couple of simple Bun tests for existing components to validate that the framework is running and fast. For example, test a context provider or a presentational component. This lays groundwork and confidence in Bun’s runner.

**Phase 2: Integrate Node A11y Testing (Day 1-2)**

- **Add Dependencies:** Install `axe-core` (or `jest-axe`) and `@testing-library/react` as devDependencies for the Node tests. Also install `jsdom` if not already included (though some testing libraries bring it in). Optionally, add `tsgo` or configure `tsc` for quick compilation of tests.

- **Node Test Script:** Create an NPM script, e.g., `"test:a11y": "node scripts/run-a11y-tests.js"`. This script can discover `*.a11y.test.tsx` files (via glob), compile them (using tsgo or esbuild), and execute them. As an interim, one could use a tool like Mocha or Vitest in Node just for these tests – but a lightweight custom runner might suffice.

- **First Axe Test:** Write an a11y test for a simple component (like a `<Button>` or a form input) and deliberately introduce a violation (e.g., remove an aria-label) to see that it catches it. Then fix the violation and see tests pass. This validates the Node axe pipeline.

- **Disable Incompatible Rules:** Configure the axe wrapper to disable `color-contrast` and other problematic rules globally for JSDOM. This can be done in a setup portion of the Node tests (for example, using `axe.configure` to turn off certain checks). Document these disabled rules clearly, referencing that Playwright will cover them.

**Phase 3: Expand Coverage in Inner Loop (Week 1 ongoing)**

- **Write Tests for Key Components:** Start adding tests (both Bun and a11y) for all crucial components in the codebase. Prioritize components that are reused often or have complex accessibility considerations (dialogs, menus, inputs, etc.). Leverage the patterns illustrated (render, axe scan, role/name assertions).

- **Enforce Query Convention:** Introduce the ESLint rules for Testing Library to ensure no one slips in a `getByTestId`. Add this to the CI lint step. Also, communicate the guideline to the team: test as a user, not via implementation details.

- **Team Training:** Host a short workshop or provide docs on how to write these new tests. Show examples of good patterns. This will help scale the effort as multiple developers contribute tests.

**Phase 4: Playwright Setup (Week 2)**

- **Install Playwright and Config:** Add Playwright test runner (`@playwright/test`) and run `npx playwright install` to get browser binaries. Create `playwright.config.ts` with proper settings: use a base URL (if running against a dev server or Storybook), configure timeouts, and set test directory (e.g., `tests/e2e`). Also enable trace on failure and screenshot on failure for debugging.

- **Axe in Playwright:** Import `@axe-core/playwright` in a test to ensure it works. Write a basic test that navigates to a page and runs an axe scan. This is to validate that our environment can do in-browser scans (and to fine-tune any needed delays/wait-fors to stabilize the page).

- **Visual Baseline:** Write a simple visual test for a static page and generate the baseline screenshot. Commit this baseline image to the repo (we generally commit reference snapshots to track changes over time). Ensure that small pixel differences don’t cause noise – adjust threshold or screenshot options if needed (like disabling anti-aliasing via CSS in test).

- **Accessibility Snapshots:** Implement the `toMatchAriaSnapshot` matcher. This might involve calling `page.accessibility.snapshot()` and doing a deep comparison with a stored object. We can also use existing example implementations from Playwright community if available. Start by snapshotting a simple component or page to test the flow (store file, compare on next run).

**Phase 5: Full E2E Test Development (Week 2-3)**

- **Implement Scenario Tests:** Begin writing tests for critical user flows: e.g., “user can navigate through main menu with keyboard,” “opening and closing modals manages focus correctly,” “form error messages are announced or present in DOM,” etc. Use the patterns from 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. These tests might require building out some test fixture data or using a staging environment if working with real backend – ensure they are deterministic.

- **Implement Visual & I18n Tests:** Add tests for visual snapshots of key pages in both themes, and for switching language as described. Mark these as either part of the main Playwright suite or a separate suite if we want to run them less frequently (Playwright can tag tests, e.g., `@visual` tag, to filter runs).

- **Parallelize where possible:** Playwright will parallelize by default; confirm that our tests are isolated (avoid tests interfering with each other by using fresh page/context for each, which Playwright does by default per test). Use test fixtures for different viewport sizes or locales to run those in parallel threads.

**Phase 6: CI Integration (Week 3)**

- **Set up CI jobs:** Modify the pipeline to include the three jobs (Bun tests, Node a11y, Playwright). Use caching where possible (cache `node_modules` or Playwright browsers for speed). If using GitHub Actions, ensure runners have necessary dependencies (or use the official Playwright action).

- **Artifact & Reporting:** Configure each job to output results. For Bun/Node tests, a simple console output might suffice, but we can also output JUnit or HTML reports using tools like `bun test --reporter junit` or a custom format. For Playwright, enable the HTML report and artifacts (videos, traces on failure). Upload these in the CI (Actions artifacts).

- **Failure Criteria:** Decide the threshold for failing. Likely any failing test fails the job. For axe violations, since our tests assert zero violations, it naturally fails if any. We might incorporate an allow-list mechanism if there are legacy known issues (though ideally fix them instead).

- **Notification:** Update PR template or guidelines to mention that a PR will not be merged if accessibility tests fail. Possibly integrate a status check that specifically surfaces “Accessibility Checks” vs “Unit Tests” so it’s clear where an issue lies.

**Phase 7: Ongoing Maintenance and Coverage (Week 4+)**

- **Backfill Tests:** Gradually increase coverage by adding tests for remaining components and pages. Our goal is not 100% coverage for coverage’s sake, but rather covering all **accessibility aspects** of each element. Use the a11y test suite as a checklist for components – if a component has an interactive role, ensure it has at least one axe test verifying its basics.

- **Update Snapshots Intentionally:** When a legitimate UI change occurs (e.g., we redesign a component’s structure or text), update the corresponding accessibility and visual snapshots. Treat these updates as code changes requiring review – double-check that the new output is correct (e.g., if a heading level changed, is that semantically acceptable?).

- **Monitor Flakiness:** Keep an eye on E2E test stability. If a test is flaky (randomly failing), investigate and fix it promptly, as flaky tests can erode team trust in the suite. Playwright’s trace viewer can help debug intermittent failures. It might be a timing issue or a test that needs a slight adjustment (like waiting for an animation to finish).

- **Continuous Improvement:** As new accessibility best practices or tools emerge, integrate them. For example, if a library for detecting screen reader announcements becomes available, we could add tests for live region updates. Or if Bun adds support for JSDOM in the future, we might simplify the Node harness and run axe directly in Bun (dropping the complexity). Remain adaptable to improve the framework.

By following this roadmap, we incrementally build up a robust testing regimen. Each phase delivers tangible benefits (immediate bug catching, new coverage) without overwhelming the team. Within a few weeks, accessibility testing moves from an abstract concern to an everyday part of development, with developers empowered by quick feedback and protected by comprehensive end-to-end checks.

### 5.2 Outcomes and Benefits

In conclusion, this accessibility-first testing architecture embeds the mantra “**shift left** on accessibility” into our development lifecycle. Fast Bun tests and Node axe checks mean issues are caught at the earliest possible moment. Playwright E2E ensures that nothing slips through the cracks when it comes to real user experience. We no longer rely solely on periodic manual audits or the diligence of individual developers remembering every ARIA rule – the system has our back.

**Key benefits we expect:**

- **Higher Quality UIs:** Fewer accessibility bugs reach production, resulting in an inclusive product by default.

- **Developer Efficiency:** Quick inner loop tests prevent context-switching; developers fix issues while the code is fresh in mind. The outer loop, while slower, is automated and saves QA effort by catching issues that would be hard to find manually.

- **Documentation by Tests:** The tests themselves serve as living documentation of our accessibility expectations. New team members can read tests to understand how components should behave (e.g., “Modal should return focus to opener on close – see test X”). This knowledge sharing is invaluable.

- **Compliance and Confidence:** We can confidently assert conformance to standards (like WCAG 2.1 AA) because we have automated checks for many criteria (contrast, focus order, semantics, etc.). This mitigates risk from a legal/compliance standpoint and broadens our user reach.

By modernizing the original design to use **Bun for speed** and a **Node assist for axe**, we preserve the core philosophy: accessibility testing should enhance, not hinder, our development velocity. Every layer of testing reinforces the other, and together they create a safety net where accessibility regressions simply cannot survive unnoticed. This is the essence of high-velocity, accessibility-first development – moving fast **without breaking things** for our users.
